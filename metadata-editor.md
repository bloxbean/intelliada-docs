# Metadata Editor

While creating a transaction \(Transfer and Token Minting\), you can also include metadata to provide addtional information about the transaction.

The plugin provides an additional tab in both Transfer  and Token Minting UIs where you can provide metadata. You can simply provide raw json or use the metadata editor to build the metadata.

Let's create a NFT with metadata.
